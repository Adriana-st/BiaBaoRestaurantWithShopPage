I have applied bootstrap grid/columns styling in the end of the Menu page in Our Dishes section.
I have changed a button on the home page to a bootstrap styled button.
I also replaced both header and footer with bootrap styled ones.
You can find replaced form on the Contact Us page, also after filling out the form it will bring you to the Thank You page, that I have created.
